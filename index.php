        <h2>What is Gridcoin?</h2>
        <p>Gridcoin is an open-source blockchain that mints and distributes cryptocurrency in relation to the processing power a network participant directs toward data-driven analysis and scientific discovery. Currently, the Gridcoin blockchain is secured through a proof-of-stake protocol and monitors processing contributions to the distributed computing infrastructure, BOINC.

        <h2>What is BOINC?</h2>
        <p>The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is an open-source distributed computing infrastructure which provides anyone with data the opportunity to process that data for near zero cost by utilizing a global volunteer-based distributed computing network.
        <br><br>
        BOINC hosts major institutional computing projects such as IBMâ€™s World Community Grid, SETI, and data from the Large Hadron Collider, alongside projects developed by students, enthusiasts, mathematicians, researchers, and citizen scientists.
