        <p>Gridcoin is an open-source blockchain that mints and distributes cryptocurrency in relation to the processing power a network participant directs toward data-driven analysis and scientific discovery. Currently, the Gridcoin blockchain is secured through a proof-of-stake protocol and monitors processing contributions to the distributed computing infrastructure, BOINC.

        <p>The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is an open-source distributed computing infrastructure which provides anyone with data the opportunity to process that data for near zero cost by utilizing a global volunteer-based distributed computing network.
        <br><br>
        BOINC hosts major institutional computing projects such as IBMâ€™s World Community Grid, SETI, and data from the Large Hadron Collider, alongside projects developed by students, enthusiasts, mathematicians, researchers, and citizen scientists.

    <h2>What are the Gridcoin Listings?</h2>
        <p>The Gridcoin listings were created to provide fair rewards, increase security and to focus user's resources on active projects. The essence of the listing processes are that projects must meet certain requirements regarding work availability, fair distribution of work and security.</p>
