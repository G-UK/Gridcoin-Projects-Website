"<p>CAS@home is hosted by the Computing Centre of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP),
Chinese Academy of Sciences. CAS@home is a volunteer computing platform for Chinese scientists based on
the BOINC volunteer computing software. CAS@home collects the volunteer contributions to computing resources
for scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other Chinese research institutions, to provide massive
free computing resources that help the scientists complete major scientific computing tasks. Therefore, CAS@home
supports multiple applications. The first application to be launched on CAS@home was developed by scientists
at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. It focused on protein structure
prediction application (software called SCThread). In addition, Tsinghua University's Centre for Micro and
Nano Mechanics (CNMM) an interdisciplinary innovation research center, has prepared an application for simulating
flow of fluids and motion of solids on the nanoscale. Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG), Chinese Academy of Sciences,
is preparing an application for gene sequencing for applications in cancer research. And physicists of the
Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, are preparing an application for
simulating particle collisions at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider, based on software called BOSS.</p>";
