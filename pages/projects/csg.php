"<p>The Citizen Science Grid is run by Travis Desell, an Assistant
Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of North
Dakota. It is hosted by UND's Computational Research Center and
Information Technology Systems and Services. The Citizen Science Grid is
dedicated to supporting a wide range of research and educational projects
using volunteer computing and citizen science.</p>
<p>The goal of DNA@Home is to discover what regulates the genes in DNA.
Ever notice that skin cells are different from a muscle cells, which are
different from a bone cells, even though all these cells have every gene
in your genome? That's because not all genes are 'on' all the time.
Depending on the cell type and what the cell is trying to do at any
given moment, only a subset of the genes are used, and the remainder are
shut off. DNA@home uses statistical algorithms to unlock the key to this
differential regulation, using your volunteered computers.</p>
<p>The Subset Sum problem is described as follows: given a set of positive
integers S and a target sum t, is there a subset of S whose sum is t? It is
one of the well-know, so-called 'hard' problems in computing. It's
actually a very simple problem computationally, and the computer program
to solve it is not extremely complicated. What's hard about it is the
running time â€“ all known exact algorithms have running time that is
proportional to an exponential function of the number of elements in
the set (for worst-case instances of the problem).</p>";
