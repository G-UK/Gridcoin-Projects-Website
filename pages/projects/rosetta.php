"<p>Rosetta@home needs your help to determine the 3-dimensional shapes of
proteins in research that may ultimately lead to finding cures for some
major human diseases. By running the Rosetta program on your computer while
you don't need it you will help us speed up and extend our research in ways
we couldn't possibly attempt without your help. You will also be helping our efforts
at designing new proteins to fight diseases such as HIV, Malaria, Cancer,
and Alzheimer's. Please join us in our efforts! Rosetta@home is not for profit.</p>
<p>We believe that we are getting closer to accurately predicting and designing
protein structures and protein complexes, one of the holy grails of computational
biology. But in order to prove this, we require an enormous amount of computing
resources, an amount greater than the world's largest super computers.
This is only achievable through a collective effort from volunteers like you.</p>";
