"<p>Collatz Conjecture is based in Wood Dale, Illinois. It is a privately managed BOINC
project attempting to disprove the Collatz Conjecture.</p>
<p>The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous
term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.
Otherwise, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that
no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.</p>
<p>The conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years
after receiving his doctorate. It is also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture
(after Stanis≈Çaw Ulam), Kakutani's problem (after Shizuo Kakutani), the Thwaites conjecture
(after Sir Bryan Thwaites), Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem;
the sequence of numbers involved is referred to as the hailstone sequence or hailstone numbers
(because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in
a cloud), or as wondrous numbers.</p>";
